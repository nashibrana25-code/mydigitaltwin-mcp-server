YOUR TASK:
Create a compelling, interview-ready response that:

1. STRUCTURE (when appropriate):
   - Uses STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
   - Opens with a confident statement
   - Includes specific metrics and achievements
   - Closes with learning or impact statement

2. CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
   - Speaks in FIRST PERSON (I did, I led, I achieved)
   - Includes SPECIFIC NUMBERS and QUANTIFIABLE RESULTS
   - Highlights TECHNICAL SKILLS and PROBLEM-SOLVING
   - Shows GROWTH MINDSET and CONTINUOUS LEARNING
   - Addresses the question DIRECTLY and COMPLETELY

3. PRESENTATION:
   - Professional yet conversational tone
   - 2-3 minutes spoken length (aim for 200-300 words)
   - Clear, confident language
   - No filler words or uncertainty

4. INTERVIEWER-SPECIFIC ADAPTATION:
${interviewerGuidance}

5. COACHING TIPS:
   After the main answer, add a brief "üí° INTERVIEW TIP:" section with:
   - Delivery advice (tone, emphasis, timing)
   - Common follow-up questions to prepare for
   - Red flags to avoid
