## Personal Match Analysis

**Overall Match Score:** 6/10 for Junior Role

**Strengths (What I Have):**

- ✅ SQL experience (1 year with MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Database systems knowledge (High Distinction grade)
- ✅ Data analysis with Python/Pandas
- ✅ Strong problem-solving skills

**Critical Gaps (What I Need to Develop):**

- ❌ No SSIS/SSRS experience
- ❌ No ETL development experience
- ❌ No data deduplication/cleansing tools experience
- ❌ No data migration project experience
- ❌ Only 1 year experience (meets Junior minimum but on the edge)
- ❌ No health/insurance domain experience

**How to Position Myself:**

**For Junior Role Application:**
1. **Lead with SQL & Database Strength:**
   - "1 year hands-on SQL experience with MySQL and PostgreSQL"
   - "High Distinction in Database Systems course"
   - "Designed database schemas for Library Management System"

2. **Emphasize Current Internship:**
   - "Currently completing 10-week AI Data Analyst Industry Project"
   - "Working with data pipelines, data migration (26 chunks)"
   - "Experience analyzing and presenting data insights"

3. **Reframe Projects as Data Analysis:**
   - Library System: "Analyzed borrowing patterns, generated reports, optimized database queries"
   - Cybersecurity: "Analyzed log data from Wazuh SIEM, identified attack patterns, presented findings"
   - Digital Twin: "Migrated and transformed data, optimized data retrieval performance"

4. **Address ETL Gap Honestly:**
   - "While I don't have Informatica experience, I have strong SQL foundations and quick learning ability"
   - "Eager to gain expertise in enterprise ETL tools"
   - "Experience with data transformation in academic and internship projects"

5. **Highlight Transferable Skills:**
   - Python for data analysis (Pandas)
   - Data presentation and documentation
   - Problem-solving under pressure
   - Client communication skills

**Realistic Assessment:**
- **Apply for Junior Role ONLY** (don't meet 3+ years for Mid)
- **Acknowledge this is a stretch role** due to Informatica/ETL gap
- **Position as learning opportunity** - strong foundation, eager to learn enterprise tools
- **Expect rejection or interview focused on learning ability**

**Alternative Strategy:**
- Look for roles that require SQL + Python + basic ETL concepts
- Avoid roles requiring specific ETL tools (Informatica, SSIS, Talend)
- Target "Graduate Data Analyst" or "Junior Analyst" roles with on-the-job training

**Questions to Ask in Interview:**

1. "What ETL tools and processes does your team use beyond Informatica?"
2. "Is there training provided for Informatica and SSIS for junior team members?"
3. "What does a typical data analysis project look like from start to finish?"
4. "How does the team balance ETL development work with data analysis tasks?"
5. "What opportunities exist for professional development and tool certifications?"
6. "Can you describe the data sources and systems I'd be working with?"

## Notes

**Red Flags:**
- Heavy emphasis on Informatica ETL (40% of job description)
- Requires "extensive knowledge" not just basic familiarity
- Consulting role may require immediate productivity
- Health/insurance domain knowledge preferred

**Learning Plan Before Applying:**
1. Complete Informatica tutorial (1-2 hours): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/informatica/index.htm
2. Watch SSIS basics on YouTube (1 hour)
3. Read about ETL best practices
4. Prepare 2-3 examples of data transformation work (even from SQL queries)

**Decision:** 
- **Priority: LOW** - Apply only after securing interviews for better-fit roles
- Better to focus on roles requiring SQL + Python + basic data analysis
- Use this as "stretch goal" application to practice addressing skill gaps
